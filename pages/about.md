Welcome to my blog!

I'm Xiaoai Zhao. I'm a postdoctoral researcher working in Stanford University. My research focuses on understanding age-associated decline in neural stem cells, and how basic cellular building block, such as lipid, contributes to the fundamental biology of aging.

Outside the lab, I enjoy hiking, camping and technologies that make our daily lives better.
