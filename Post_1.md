How about adding a `script`

I decided that **Pixyll** is a good theme[@lorentPlasmaMembranesAre2020].

H~2~O

WDR5^l/l^

==highlighting== also works! [@violetaAgeDependentNicheSignals2016]

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### can you follow text after after heading?

**I guess not**. The way to go is probably just to bold the beginning of the paragraph [@leventalLipidomicBiophysicalHomeostasis2020]

Figureing out how to use git checkout -commit 1 [@owenFluorescenceLifetimeImaging2006]

Now I wan to add another version - commit 2[@holcapekLipidomicAnalysis2018]

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
Is this a page break?

Yet another change - commit 3 and this is what a [link](www.xiaoaizhao.com) looks like.

How does table of content work?

[toc]

This is interesting! it shows all the levels of headlines and is in sync when changed.

Try mermaid chart
