# Academic writing in markdown language - why it's the way forward and you should definitely give it a try.

## How did I get into markdown writing

### current status of writing biology paper

#### Pros, low learning threshold, low coding skill needed

#### Cons, proprietary software, compatibility with OS platform and versions

	* LaTex meet all criteria, steep learning curve
	* It's great for math, physics, uniqueness for bioscience paper (almost no math, typesetting is done by journal, not all journals accept LaTeX)

### requirement for a platform agnostic, flexible writing system with the ability to citation tools that has the ability to handle citation styles of different journal.

## Workflow

### Reference management

Zotero

### Writing

#### Typora - beautiful, distraction-free layout, WYSIWYG, no auto-complete citation, can manually add bibtex

#### Atom - for auto-complete citation insertion

#### Pandoc - export to any given file format, apply citation style

### All-in-one platform - Zettlr



When it comes to academic writing - I'm using this general term to refer to writing journal articles, research grant proposals and book chapters, there is almost never a debate on what technical tool to use and how to get started. You open a new Word document and type away, at least this has been the status in the biomedical research field for a long time. Biologists comply to this norm for a few reasons: 1) There is virtually no barrier of entry - everyone knows how to navigate Microsoft Word to some degree. Sure, you might need to learn a few commands and functions that are unique to academic writing, namely inserting and managing reference citations (usually from EndNote or other citation management software), but you pick it up along the way. 2) It becomes a standard in the field when scientific journals reinforce the use of Word document. Most of  journals across all tiers in biomedical research field requires manuscript submission in Word. Even when they are open to papers prepared in LaTeX, they require these manuscripts to be converted to Word document at somepoint during the editorial process, for instance, at [time of submission](https://www-sciencemag-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/authors/science-information-authors) or [after acceptance](http://www.nature.com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/nature/for-authors/formatting-guide). 3) Perhaps the strongest force contributing to this norm is just the fact that _everyone is using Word._ Contrary to common perceptions of scientist who is hunched over writing by him/herself, academic writing is and has been incredibly collaborative. Research articles which involve multiple scientists working together have more than one authors contributing to paper-writing. It helps that eveyone is using the same software and can work on the document together. Even in the cases of "Single-author writing" such as drafting grant proposals, you constantly seek comments/feedbacks from your peers and mentors. This makes features such as track change and adding comments an integral part of the process. 

With everything mentioned so far, sticking with Word sounds like a no-brainer. But more and more so I have begun to feel the painpoints that this system created in the writing process.<!-- the previous sentence needs to be polished--> Both Word and EndNote are proprietary softwares, which means they are not free. Usually it's a non-issue since they are provided by most universities and research institutions. However in this day and age when we are debating open access journals vs. traditional journals, a preference for transitioning over to open-source softwares for academic writing shouldn't simply be brushed over. But let's say you don't care about any of this, what about the countless times when suddenly Word crashes as soon as you try to use EndNote. Or when your co-authors made a change in a shared Word document but it shows up incorrectly on your end. Or the most concerning of all - references were missing or wrong because different versions of softwares were involved. Almost all of these problems can be attributed to version and operating system incompatibility in one or more of these softwares. Thy cause everything from minor annoyances to serious erratum, and it's precisely what motivated me to spend some time looking for a better alternative. 

Taking into account all considerations, the ideal infrastructure for academic writing specifically in the biomedical research field should meeting the following criteria:

##### Required

1. Easy to learn and easy to transition for people who have been exclusively using Word previously.
2. Flexibility writing system for style formatting.
3. Ability to integrate and stylize citations.
4. Easy to convert to specific file format required for journal submission.
5. Amenable to collaborative writing and can incorporate edits and comments.

##### Preferred

1. Operating system agnostic (able to run on MacOS, Windows and Linux etc.) and open-source.
2. Future-proof. Failure or success of any given company does not hijack the entire workflow. In another word, you do not have to go back to the drawing board 5-10 years down the road just because the company who makes your favorite text-writing software decide to go bankrupt.
