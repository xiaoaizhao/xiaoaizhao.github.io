# Academic writing in markdown language - why it's the way forward and you should definitely give it a try.

## How did I get into markdown writing

### current status of writing biology paper

#### Pros, low learning threshold, low coding skill needed

#### Cons, proprietary software, compatibility with OS platform and versions

	 - LaTex meet all criteria, steep learning curve
	 - It's great for math, physics, uniqueness for bioscience paper (almost no math, typesetting is done by journal, not all journals accept LaTeX)

### requirement for a platform agnostic, flexible writing system with the ability to citation tools that has the ability to handle citation styles of different journal.

## Workflow

### Reference management

Zotero

### Writing

#### Typora - beautiful, distraction-free layout, WYSIWYG, no auto-complete citation, can manually add bibtex

#### Atom - for auto-complete citation insertion

#### Pandoc - export to any given file format, apply citation style

### All-in-one platform - Zettlr



When it comes to academic writing - I'm using this general term to refer to writing journal articles, research grant proposals and book chapters, there is almost never a debate on what technical tool to use and how to get started. You open a new Word document and type away, at least this has been the status in the biomedical research field for a long time. Biologists comply to this norm for a few reasons: 1) There is virtually no barrier of entry - everyone knows how to navigate Microsoft Word to some degree. Sure, you might need to learn a few commands and functions that are unique to academic writing, namely inserting and managing reference citations, but you pick it up along the way. 2) It becomes a standard in the field when scientific journals reinforce the use of Word document. Most of  journals across all tiers in biomedical research field requires manuscript submission in Word. Even when they are open to papers prepared in LaTeX, they require these manuscripts to be converted to Word document at somepoint during the editorial process, for instance, at [time of submission](https://www-sciencemag-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/authors/science-information-authors) or [after acceptance](http://www.nature.com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/nature/for-authors/formatting-guide). 3) Perhaps the strongest force contributing to this norm is just the fact that _everyone is using Word._ Contrary to common perceptions of scientists who are hunched over writing by him/herself, academic writing is and has been incredibly collaborative. Research articles which involve multiple scientists working together have more than one authors contributing to paper-writing. Even in the cases of "Single-author writing" such as drafting grant proposals, you constantly seek comments/feedbacks from your peers and mentors. This makes features such as track change and add comment an integral part of the process.
